=head1 NAME

Mojo::Reactor::Poll - Low-level event reactor with poll support

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::Reactor::Poll;

  # Watch if handle becomes readable or writable
  my $reactor = Mojo::Reactor::Poll->new;
  $reactor->io($first => sub {
    my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
    say $writable ? 'First handle is writable' : 'First handle is readable';
  });

  # Change to watching only if handle becomes writable
  $reactor->watch($first, 0, 1);

  # Turn file descriptor into handle and watch if it becomes readable
  my $second = IO::Handle->new_from_fd($fd, 'r');
  $reactor->io($second => sub {
    my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
    say $writable ? 'Second handle is writable' : 'Second handle is readable';
  })->watch($second, 1, 0);

  # Add a timer
  $reactor->timer(15 => sub {
    my $reactor = shift;
    $reactor->remove($first);
    $reactor->remove($second);
    say 'Timeout!';
  });

  # Start reactor if necessary
  $reactor->start unless $reactor->is_running;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::Reactor::Poll> is a low-level event reactor based on L<IO::Poll>.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Mojo::Reactor::Poll> inherits all events from L<Mojo::Reactor>.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojo::Reactor::Poll> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::Reactor> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 again

  $reactor->again($id);

Restart timer. Note that this method requires an active timer.

=head2 io

  $reactor = $reactor->io($handle => sub {...});

Watch handle for I/O events, invoking the callback whenever handle becomes
readable or writable.

  # Callback will be executed twice if handle becomes readable and writable
  $reactor->io($handle => sub {
    my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
    say $writable ? 'Handle is writable' : 'Handle is readable';
  });

=head2 is_running

  my $bool = $reactor->is_running;

Check if reactor is running.

=head2 next_tick

  my $undef = $reactor->next_tick(sub {...});

Execute callback as soon as possible, but not before returning or other
callbacks that have been registered with this method, always returns C<undef>.

=head2 one_tick

  $reactor->one_tick;

Run reactor until an event occurs or no events are being watched anymore.

  # Don't block longer than 0.5 seconds
  my $id = $reactor->timer(0.5 => sub {});
  $reactor->one_tick;
  $reactor->remove($id);

=head2 recurring

  my $id = $reactor->recurring(0.25 => sub {...});

Create a new recurring timer, invoking the callback repeatedly after a given
amount of time in seconds.

=head2 remove

  my $bool = $reactor->remove($handle);
  my $bool = $reactor->remove($id);

Remove handle or timer.

=head2 reset

  $reactor->reset;

Remove all handles and timers.

=head2 start

  $reactor->start;

Start watching for I/O and timer events, this will block until L</"stop"> is
called or no events are being watched anymore.

  # Start reactor only if it is not running already
  $reactor->start unless $reactor->is_running;

=head2 stop

  $reactor->stop;

Stop watching for I/O and timer events.

=head2 timer

  my $id = $reactor->timer(0.5 => sub {...});

Create a new timer, invoking the callback after a given amount of time in
seconds.

=head2 watch

  $reactor = $reactor->watch($handle, $readable, $writable);

Change I/O events to watch handle for with true and false values. Note that
this method requires an active I/O watcher.

  # Watch only for readable events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 1, 0);

  # Watch only for writable events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 1);

  # Watch for readable and writable events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 1, 1);

  # Pause watching for events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 0);
